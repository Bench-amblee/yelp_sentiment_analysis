**Problem Statement**

Online reviews are a common way for customers to share their thoughts on a service or product. With so much text-based data, it's impossible for a human to keep up and read through every review. While the common five-star rating system works as a simple solution, there needs to be a better way to gather more insight from the enourmous amounts of text-based data.

**Context**

This data was sourced from Yelp.com, with over 10,000 unique reviews from 200+ restaurants in New York City. The data is unlabled and will have to be classified in order to train the model. 

**Goals**

- Analyze each review and find relevant trends and relationships
- Classify the training data based on review content
- Create a prediction model with high accuracy and F1 score
