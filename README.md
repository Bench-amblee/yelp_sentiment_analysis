**Problem Statement**

Online reviews are a common way for customers to share their thoughts on a service or product. With so much text-based data, it's impossible for a human to keep up and read through every review. While the common five-star rating system works as a simple solution, there needs to be a better way to gather more insight from the enourmous amounts of text-based data.
